# Arduino Enhanced Toy Car

A toy car powered by Arduino with advanced features, including sensor support, modules, and addressable LEDs.

## Features:
1. **Distance Sensor**: The toy car responds to obstacles by changing the blink rate of the LED.
2. **RFID Reader**: Allows for identification of RFID tags and controls access based on registered IDs.
3. **Addressable LEDs (NeoPixels)**: Used to simulate car lights, including turn signals and high/low beam lights.
4. **Servo**: Used to simulate a lock mechanism.

## Connection Scheme:
[Full Project Documentation](Documentation.pdf)

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (RFID, Servo, Adafruit_NeoPixel, etc.).
3. Load the code onto your Arduino device.
4. Test different functions by approaching RFID cards, pressing buttons, etc.

## Libraries:
- RFID.h: For handling the RFID reader.
- Servo.h: For controlling the servo.
- Adafruit_NeoPixel.h: For controlling the addressable LEDs.

## Collaboration:
